# GardenWarfare

A mod for Space Engineers that provides provide attackers and defenders with a completely 
re-imagined and balanced set of weapons, armor, and thrusters to make combat more interesting and
require more strategic and tactical decision making.

# Guidelines

* This is be a single mod, we can use concepts from others and models/textures with permission from their authors. But I think we’re going to have a lot of modelling and texturing to do.
* Textures should be reusable as much as possible, with DX11 textures get to 5mb each and we’d like to keep file size down. 
* Model style should be realistic, fit with SE styling, be fairly low poly, but can definitely look very cool
* Weapon and armor tech should be realistically achievable in the near-future, roughly 10-50 years from now.
* Weapon and armor interaction should be based on real physics 
* Limitations of the SE engine can possibly be dealt with via PRs, so let’s not assume anything is impossible until proven so
* We need to have tiers of everything - provide some nice progression for players and make the heavy hitting stuff worth working for
* We need a large set of effective ranges - some things work best at 500m, others at 15km. Both turrets, static weapons, missiles etc should engage at various ranges for more interesting combat
